Method

    Mix the oil with the garlic, chilli, salt and paprika, then toss in the prawns. Marinate the prawns in the fridge for up to 1 day.

    TO BARBECUE: Cook the prawns singly or thread 3 onto skewers to make portions. Barbecue for just a few mins each side until they turn from grey to pink. Serve with the mint relish (just tiny pots per portion), warm finger bowls with lime slices, napkins, and a bowl for the shells.
